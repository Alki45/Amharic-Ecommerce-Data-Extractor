# ðŸ“¦ Amharic E-commerce NER System

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** in Amharic text, specifically targeting messages from **Telegram-based e-commerce businesses in Ethiopia**. This system ingests raw data (text + media), preprocesses it, and prepares labeled datasets in **CoNLL format** for training NER models to identify entities like products, prices, and locations in Amharic.

## ðŸš€ Project Objective

The goal is to support **EthioMart** and similar e-commerce ventures in automating their product listing and price tracking pipelines using a robust Amharic-language NER system. This project addresses:

- âœ… High volume of unstructured Telegram product posts  
- âœ… Real-time product, price, and location extraction  
- âœ… Lack of Amharic-language datasets for commercial NLP applications
